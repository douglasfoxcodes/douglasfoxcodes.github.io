Amongst the rituals common to backpackers there is one question that stands out as the most ridiculous.

> "Which countries have you DONE?"

Which is often followed with an answer like...

> "I DID countries A, B, C."

**It's a laughable phrase.**

The words 'DID' and 'DONE' do a huge discredit to both the countries we travel to and the experiences we have within them.

We talk about how much time you can spend in a city or country before you've seen it – before you've 'done it'. "You only need a week in Cambodia". "72 hours is more than enough in Lisbon". "Only visit Frankfurt if you've got a long layover".

I'm sure anyone who has spent significant time in Cambodia, Lisbon or Frankfurt would condemn you for these comments.

The word "Done" means you've completed something. How could you ever complete a city or a country or a continent.

It's as if travel is simply a checklist of 200+ countries that we're trying to place our feet within the borders of before we hit the bucket.

The longer you spend in a city the greater the experience. It can take weeks or months (longer even) before a city opens up her heart.

Every city has a tourist layer that your average traveller will struggle to break through. Though many are content with experiencing only the tourist layer, the hardiest will not. They want more.

The tourist layer exists for three reasons...

1. **We're time constrained** – whether you're backpacking for an extended period or on a weekend retreat, the time you'll spend in any one place is short;
2. **They're plotting against you** – you're happy to pay businesses geared to tourists to maximise your constrained time.
3. **Language barriers** – businesses operating for tourists will speak the tourist's language, it's hard for us to ignore our own language when we're in a country where no one else is speaking to us.

Perhaps when traveller-types say they've 'done' a country they actually mean they've exhausted the tourist layer.

Making a lifestyle of travel, as many digital nomads do, allows us to travel slower than your budget constrained backpacker. Those of us who are able to afford a slow travel lifestyle (and by afford I mean financially and without location dependent responsibilities) are an incredibly priveledged subset of travellers.

We are in a position to really experience a country – to smash through the tourist layer.

The absence of invisible time handcuffs let's us settle into a location, make friends with locals and expats alike. Without tight time constraints we aren't subject to the same pressure to rush through the whole city in a weekend. Instead we can find the hidden gems one-by-one: the splendid neighbourhoods, the spectacular views, the delicous local cuisine.

**So let's ask the better question: "Which countries have you truly experienced?".**
