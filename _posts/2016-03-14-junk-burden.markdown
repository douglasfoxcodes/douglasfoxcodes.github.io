I was talking to a friend about a new country I’m going to visit. They had previously visited and offered their copy of the Lonely Planet guide. A very nice gesture.

As a nomadic worker I travel light, super light in fact – a small ~20L backpack. I don’t have any extra space. The items I carry have been carefully selected for their purpose and for their interaction with other items I own.

I had three options…

1. Borrow the book. I could take the book and return it when I am next in my friends company. That will likely be more than 6 months. In that time I will physically have to carry that book in my backpack displacing another item.
2. Borrow the book and throw it away. I will only be in this next location for a period of a few weeks so why carry it for the entirety of my trip? However, this is my friend's possession. They have entrusted me with it. I can’t just throw it away when I’m done with it.
3. Don’t take the book. Don’t take the book and miss out on the great tips and tricks within it’s pages.

**Here is an inanimate object (the guide book) and becoming its ‘owner’ burdens me with decisions about it’s existence.**

I’ll admit, the concerns I have regarding this guidebook are trivial. It’s a small item and the burden I feel is only exacerbated because of my own lifestyle choices – single bag travel.

Consider instead, home ownership. A far more valuable possession.

Homeowners suffer a significant burden. A house is the largest purchase we’ll likely ever make which will take years for us to pay off entirely. Upon signing the mortgage agreement we’re instantly committed to hours of paid-work to fulfil our obligations.

Additionally the home needs to be maintained. Homeowners experience a second set of burdens relating to time: hours a week are devoted to cleaning and repairing our homes.

**From the smallest possessions to the largest, we experience junk burdens. Junk burdens are not always obvious, but they are present always. The larger, the more expensive, the more complex the possession, the greater the burden becomes.**
