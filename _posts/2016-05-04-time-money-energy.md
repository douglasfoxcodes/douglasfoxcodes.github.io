At any point in our lives we have two of three things: time, money and energy.

When you are a child, you have time and energy but no money.
So you can’t do what you want.

When we are a working adult, we have money and energy but no time.
So we can’t do what we want.

When we are retired, we have money and time but no energy.
So we can’t do what we want.

We have true freedom of choice then we find all three things in quantity.

Manage each carefully. Don’t fritter any away. Don’t take any for granted.
