I'm Douglas Fox, a digital nomad: one of those smug folk who travel the world and work from their laptop.

I like asking questions to get to the root of what makes people tick and encouraging them to pursue their passions through intentional lifestyle design and minimalism.

This website is an outlet and collection for my personal thoughts â€“ a place to put ideas public and see what resonates.

Thanks for stopping by.
